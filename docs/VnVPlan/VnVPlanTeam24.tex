\section{General Information}
\subsection{Summary}
The software being tested is an UNO Flip game application, developed to provide an engaging, digital version of the popular card game with additional features for enhanced user experience. The game includes functionalities such as switching between two sides of the cards (light and dark), maintaining score, tracking player moves, and handling various card effects.

\subsection{Objectives}
The primary objective of the Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan is to build confidence in the correctness and stability of the game software, ensuring a smooth user experience with minimal bugs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Verifying functionality: Testing core game mechanics, such as card flipping, turn-taking, and scoring.
    \item Ensuring performance: Assessing the softwareâ€™s responsiveness.
    \item Evaluating user experience: Conducting usability tests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}
The challenge level for this project is general, focusing on main gameplay mechanics without advanced AI or complex networking.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
Relevant documents such as the SRS and PSAG are available, which define requirements and project goals.

\section{Plan}
This section provides an overview of the planned verification and validation (VnV) activities for our project.
