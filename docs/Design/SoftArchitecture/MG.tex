\section{Introduction}

Developing software through modular decomposition is a well-accepted practice in software engineering. A module is defined as a work assignment for a programmer or programming team 24. This approach allows the software system to be divided into manageable components, enhancing scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. In this project, we follow the principle of information hiding \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24626/abstraction-vs-information-hiding-vs-encapsulation}{ POIH}, which is essential for accommodating changes during development and maintenance. Given the dynamic and interactive nature of the UNO Flip game, this principle is particularly relevant to ensure flexibility as new features or rules may be incorporated in the future.

UNO Flip is a modern twist on the traditional UNO card game, incorporating an innovative double-sided card deck with "light" and "dark" sides. Players are challenged to adapt their strategies dynamically as the game flips between these two modes. Our goal for this project is to design and develop a digital version of UNO Flip that emulates the physical gameplay experience while adding features like automated rule enforcement, multiplayer support, and interactive animations.

To ensure a robust and maintainable design, we adhere to the modular design principles established by \href{https://cabibbo.dia.uniroma3.it/asw/altrui/parnas-1972.pdf}{David L. Parnas}


\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently, such as game rules or graphical user interface (GUI) elements, are encapsulated within separate modules.
\item Each data structure, such as the card deck, player hands, or game state, is implemented in only one module.
\item Inter-module communication is facilitated through well-defined access programs to ensure data encapsulation and minimize dependencies.
\end{itemize}

After completing the initial design phase, including the Software Requirements Specification 
\href{https://github.com/simon-0215/UNO-Flip-3D/tree/main/docs/SRS-Volere}{SRS Volere }, we created the Module Guide \href{https://github.com/simon-0215/UNO-Flip-3D/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{ (MG)}. The MG outlines the modular structure of the system and serves as a comprehensive reference for all stakeholders. This document is aimed at the following audiences:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{New project members:} The MG provides a clear overview of the system's modular structure, enabling new members to understand the architecture and locate relevant modules efficiently.
\item \textbf{Maintainers:} The hierarchical organization of the MG simplifies the process of identifying and updating the relevant modules when changes are made to the system. Maintainers are encouraged to update the MG to reflect any modifications accurately.
\item \textbf{Designers:} The MG acts as a verification tool to ensure consistency, feasibility, and flexibility in the system design. Designers can assess the coherence among modules, the viability of the decomposition, and the adaptability of the design to future changes.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this document is structured as follows. Section~\ref{SecChange} outlines the anticipated and unlikely changes in the software requirements, such as the introduction of new game rules or enhancements to the multiplayer functionality. Section~\ref{SecMH} describes the module decomposition strategy, constructed based on the principle of likely changes. Section~\ref{SecConnection} details the connections between the software requirements and the modules. Section~\ref{SecMD} provides a comprehensive description of each module, including its responsibilities and dependencies. Section~\ref{SecTM} includes traceability matrices to ensure the completeness of the design relative to the requirements and anticipated changes. Finally, Section~\ref{SecUse} discusses the use relationships between modules, highlighting their interactions and dependencies.

This modular approach ensures that our UNO Flip software can be developed efficiently while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future requirements and user feedback.


\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific
  hardware on which the software is running. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} The game should adapt to various hardware platforms, such as desktops, mobile devices, and consoles, by leveraging Unity's cross-platform build tools.
  
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format of the
  initial input data. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Unity's Input System allows for flexibility in handling various input methods, such as touch, gamepad, or keyboard input, without impacting the overall game functionality.
  
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUI}:] Updating the user interface for accessibility and improved user experience. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Changes in UI elements, such as adding new accessibility features or redesigning layouts, can be achieved without affecting the underlying game logic due to Unity's modular UI Toolkit.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acNetwork}:] The communication protocol for multiplayer functionality. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Switching from an existing protocol (e.g., UDP) to a more secure or efficient one (e.g., WebSockets) should only require modifications to the networking module.
\end{description}

\wss{Anticipated changes relate to changes that would be made in requirements,
design or implementation choices.  They are not related to changes that are made
at run-time, like the values of parameters.}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decisions should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen). \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Changing I/O devices is considered unlikely since the Unity Input System already supports a wide range of devices, and most use cases are covered by the current implementation.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucEngine}:] Switching the game engine from Unity to another platform. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Rebuilding the game using a different engine would require re-implementation of all assets, scripts, and logic, making this change highly unlikely.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucMechanics}:] Fundamental changes to the core gameplay mechanics. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Altering the basic rules of UNO Flip, such as removing the "Flip" mechanic, would require significant rewrites across multiple modules.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucAssets}:] Replacing all graphical assets with a new visual theme. \\
  \textit{Explanation:} Although possible, replacing all assets would involve modifying Unity scenes, prefabs, and animations extensively, which is not a likely requirement.
\end{description}


\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Hardware-Hiding Module \\
  \textit{Purpose:} This module isolates hardware-specific dependencies, such as rendering devices, input devices, and memory management. It allows the rest of the system to remain platform-independent by using Unity's built-in hardware abstraction.
  
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mBH}:] Software Decision Module \\
  \textit{Purpose:} Encapsulates the core gameplay logic, such as player actions, turn mechanics, and rule enforcement, ensuring that other modules can interact with game behavior through a unified interface.

\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mSD}:] Behaviour-Hiding Module \\
  \textit{Purpose:} Handles system-wide decisions, including UI updates, multiplayer network protocols, and game state transitions. This module integrates decisions that impact user interaction and system-wide consistency.

\end{description}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\end{itemize}


\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

\end{table}




\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

\wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}

\section{User Interfaces}

The user interface (UI) design for this system focuses on creating an intuitive and accessible experience for players. The UI consists of both software and hardware elements that enable seamless interaction with the game. Below are the primary components of the UI design:

\subsection{Software User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Main Menu:} The main menu provides options for starting a new game, loading a saved game, viewing instructions, and accessing settings.
    \item \textbf{Game Screen:} The game screen displays the game state, including player scores, active cards, and the current turn. Interactive elements allow players to perform actions such as playing a card or drawing from the deck.
    \item \textbf{Pop-Up Notifications:} Notifications are used to inform players about special events, such as a "Skip" card being played or a turn being reversed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Devices:} Supports mouse, keyboard, and touchscreens for input.
    \item \textbf{Output Devices:} Designed for compatibility with various screen sizes and resolutions.
\end{itemize}



\section{Design of Communication Protocols}

The communication protocols in this system ensure reliable and efficient data exchange between modules, especially for multiplayer functionality. These protocols are designed to handle various aspects such as real-time data synchronization, error handling, and security.

\subsection{Protocol Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transport Layer:} Uses WebSocket protocol for real-time communication in multiplayer games. Ensures low latency and high reliability.
    \item \textbf{Message Format:} Messages are serialized using JSON for simplicity and compatibility. Each message includes a header (e.g., message type) and a body (e.g., card played, turn updated).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Handling and Recovery}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Connection Loss:} Implements a reconnection mechanism to recover lost connections without disrupting the game state.
    \item \textbf{Invalid Messages:} Validates incoming messages to ensure compliance with the protocol specification. Invalid messages are logged and discarded.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Encryption:} All data exchanged between clients and the server is encrypted using TLS to ensure data security.
    \item \textbf{Authentication:} Players are authenticated via a token-based system to prevent unauthorized access.
\end{itemize}
