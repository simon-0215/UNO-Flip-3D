\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}
Existing Implementation: \href{https://unoonline.io/}{UNO Online Website}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flipped Feature:}
    In addition to the ordinary UNO Flip game, we also added the flip feature to let every card show different sides with complete new new number and colour to make the game more challenging and fun to play.
    \item \textbf{Message Box:} In the traditional game, the game only shows the user what is the next step to take by showing them the appropriate animations. This might make some users confused about game instructions. Therefore, We introduce the message box feature to inform the user what is the next step to take with more clarity since language is usually more effective than animations.
    \item \textbf{Game Instructions:} We made a dedicated interface that can be accessed from the main interface to show the game instruction in details to the users. In this way, users do not have to spend extra time to search on the Internet or blindly playing games to know how the game works.
    \item \textbf{Design and Aesthetics:} Our software features a more simplified version of graphical user interface with no complicated graphics and animations. This reduce the probability that the user gets confused and make the overall experience more clean and easy to follow.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility:} Our software have a improved colour contrast to let user easily identify different features. We also added the arrow feature in multiplayer to tell user the current game playing direction so that the user can calculate the chance of winning. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Unit Testing}
Unit testing is a software testing methodology that involves testing individual components of a program in isolation to ensure they work as expected. It is typically automated and performed at the early stages of development or the merging process to detect and fix bugs before they propagate to later stages or affecting other software components. In our software, when our team members finished writing the code, we usually test each individual functions or code components manually by inserting normal, abnormal and edge cases in order to make sure each individual components perform as expected. For integration testing, we do implement the appropriate CI in our GitHub. Please refer to section 8 for more details.
\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\section{Automated Testing}
For the automated testing, we implemented the CodeQL Advanced in our GitHub actions that scan newly integrated code to ensure our code base is free of vulnerability and fits with each other. We had used the original script for our testings. Overall, all testing has been successful since the implementation of this CI action. However, since there are still some functionalities in our software needed to be consummated, we need to find a better CI actions which check our Unity code with more specialty or change our existing script to better suite the nature of our code. This will make our integration more smoothly and reduce the time for us to debug our code and will be one of our next main focus of the development.

\section{Trace to Requirements}

\section{Trace to Modules}
This section maps unit tests to the software modules responsible for implementing them. This ensures that each module is properly verified through testing.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Unit Test} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Module} \\
        \hline
        UT-01 & Validate user authentication (login/logout) functionality & Authentication.cs \\
        UT-02 & Ensure game room creation and joining works correctly & GameManager.cs, Menu.cs \\
        UT-03 & Verify player turn management and synchronization & GameManager.cs, Player.cs \\
        UT-04 & Test real-time chat functionality within game rooms & ChatManager.cs \\
        UT-05 & Validate scoring system calculations and display & ScoreManager.cs \\
        UT-06 & Ensure game correctly handles end-game scenarios & GameManager.cs \\
        UT-07 & Check AI opponent decision-making logic & AiPlayer.cs \\
        UT-08 & Test multiplayer state synchronization in real time & NetworkManager.cs \\
        UT-09 & Verify user profile storage and retrieval functions & UserProfile.cs \\
        UT-10 & Test security measures such as encryption & SecurityManager.cs \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Traceability of Unit Tests to Modules}
    \label{tab:trace_modules}
\end{table}

By linking unit tests to specific software modules, we ensure that all core functionalities are adequately verified.


\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
There are 9 main scripts in our project. The aim is to reach at least 80\% code coverage in the project. Below is a list of the scripts along with the code coverage percentage for each one:
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Scripts} & \textbf{Code Coverage (\%)} \\
        \hline
        AiPlayer.cs & 80\% \\ 
        Card.cs & 80\% \\ 
        CardDisplay.cs & 80\% \\ 
        CardInteraction.cs & 80\% \\ 
        Deck.cs & 80\% \\ 
        GameManager.cs & 80\% \\ 
        Menu.cs & 80\% \\ 
        Player.cs & 80\% \\ 
        WildButton.cs & 80\% \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Code Coverage for Each Script}
    \label{tab:code_coverage}
\end{table}
Notice that the most important script is GameManger which deals with most of the game logic. This will be the most important script to test.
